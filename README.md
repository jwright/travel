A daily log of my adventures in trying to not own a car.


## RESOURCES

* My wife's car - My wife owns the family car. She has a day job as a teacher and uses it every weekday. We both use it to tote the brats around.
* My daughter's car - I have an 18yo daughter who is away at school but home during the summers. She does not take the car to school. It's not in the greatest of shapes but it get's everywhere locally fine.
* Neighbor - I have a giant neighbor who works near my office in downtown Toledo. Sometimes I hitch a ride with him.
* Lyft - *not* Uber - It's pretty easy to get a Lyft around my house. Average time for the Lyft to arrive is 8 - 10 minutes.
* Bike - We live in a township and around 2 miles from any store.
* Legs - I luckily have both.
